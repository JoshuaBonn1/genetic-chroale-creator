# genetic-chroale-creator
Using genetic algorithms, this program will automatically generate lilypond files with chorales.

To compile, I used gcc fullProgram.c. 
To mess with the stats of the genetic algorithm, edited the stats.h file.

The program creates two files, error.txt and chorale.ly. 

error.txt is a file listing where the errors are in the chorale.
chorale.ly is a lilypond file that can be compiled in lilybin.com or any lilypond compiler.
